OCLCrack is just another MD5 hash cracker that can utilize the power of the GPU.
The program uses OpenCL, so it should be able to run on any hardware that
implements this GPGPU standard. That said, it was developed on, and is optimized
for the CUDA architecture, so there can be problems (mostly performance-related)
on other platforms.
For usage information, please use the --help option.
